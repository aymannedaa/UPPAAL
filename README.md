# UPPAAL
UPPAAL SMC models of 2 intersection management policies. The models where developed as part of my masters thesis work in Aalto Univeristy. 

Thesis title: "Modeling and Simulation of Autonomous Intersection Management protocols". The thesis document can be found above.  

Both UPPAAL files should be run using UPPAAL version 4.1.19 (or higher) which includes a Statistical Model Checker(SMC) extension. 

UPPAAL can be downloaded from here: http://www.uppaal.org/
